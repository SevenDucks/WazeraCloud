        				<h2>The Document Tree</h2>
        				<p>
        					The main feature of the "Docs" page is the document tree,
        					which completely fills the left column of the screen.
        					It displays every document in the database, that you have access to.
        					Each document has an icon in front of it, to represent its type.
        					However only "Folder" documents can contain other documents,
        					similar to the file explorer in Windows or other operating systems.
        					The "Dashboard" also behaves like a folder, with the exception
        					that it is the root of the tree and cannot be moved, renamed or deleted.
        					When a folder has any content, an arrow will appear next to its icon,
        					letting you expand or collapse the content.
        					Left clicking a document will open it,
        					displaying its content on the right column of the screen.
        					You can only have one document opened at a time.
        					Right clicking a document will show you a context menu,
        					displaying all available actions.
        					This way you can create or modify documents.

        				<h2>The User Database</h2>
        				<p>
        					On the "Users" page, admins will find a big table of all users,
        					known as the user database.
        					The fields in the header allow you to filter for
        					usernames or database IDs.
        					You will find a button to create new entries in the footer on the very bottom.
        					Each user entry provides edit and delete options in the leftmost column.
        					All listed users, will be able to log into Wazera.
        				</p>
        				<h2>User Pages</h2>
        				<p>
        					Clicking the edit option on an user will bring you to the user page.
        					You can also go to your own user page by clicking the profile button.
        					Under "Profile Page" you will find user related infos in the future.
        					Under "Change Password" you can set a new password for the user.
        					Under "Assign Roles" you can edit the roles of the user to change their permissions.
        					Global roles can simply be assigned with a checkbox.
        					Group roles will have additional checkboxes - one for each group in the database.
        					This way you can make the permissions of that role only impact documents within
        					one or multiple groups. You can also just check the global checkbox,
        					to apply it for everything, including ungrouped documents.
        					To save changes to a user, simply press the save button at the bottom.

        					On the "Groups" page, admins will find a big table of all groups,
        					known as the group database.
        					The fields in the header allow you to filter for
        					group names or database IDs.
        					You will find a button to create new entries in the footer on the very bottom.
        					Each group entry provides edit and delete options in the leftmost column.
        					Groups are currently unused and have no effect.

        				<h2>The Role Database</h2>
        				<p>
        					On the "Roles" page, admins will find a big table of all roles,
        					known as the role database.
        					The fields in the header allow you to filter for
        					role names, scopes or database IDs.
        					You will find a button to create new entries in the footer on the very bottom.
        					Each role entry provides edit and delete options in the leftmost column.
        					All listed roles, will be assignable to users.
        				</p>
        				<h2>Role Pages</h2>
        				<p>
        					Clicking the edit option on a role will bring you to the role page.
        					Under "Assign Permissions" you will be able to set
        					what users with this role can and can't do.
        					You are also able to freely change the name of the role here.
        					The scope determines what kind of permissions can be assigned.
        					GLOBAL permissions are used to give access to features,
        					that impact the whole application.
        					GROUP permissions on the other hand only impact confined spaces.
        					For example, you could create a group scoped role with the permission
        					to edit documents. When assigning this permission from the user page,
        					you can choose to only apply it to a certain group.
        					Now the user can edit documents that belong to this group,
        					while the option would stay disabled on a document within another group.
        					You can also assign group scoped roles globally,
        					so they apply for all groups.
        					To save changes to a role, simply press the save button at the bottom.
